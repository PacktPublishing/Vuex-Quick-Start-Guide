# Vuex Quick Start Guide
This is the code repository for [Vuex Quick Start Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/vuex-quick-start-guide?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788999939), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book starts off by comparing Vue.js with other frameworks and setting up the development environment for your application. It gradually moves on to writing and styling clean, maintainable, and reusable components that can be used across your application.

Moving on, you'll look at common UI patterns, Vue form submission, and various modifiers such as lazy binding, number typecasting, and string trimming to create better UIs. You will also explore best practices for integrating HTTP into Vue.js applications to create an application with dynamic data.

Routing is a vitally important part of any SPA, so you will focus on the Vue route and explore routing a user between multiple pages. Next, you'll also explore state management with Vuex, write testable code for your application, and create performant, server-side rendered applications with Nuxt.

Towards the end we'll look at common anti-patterns to avoid, to save you from a lot of trial and error and development headaches.

By the end of this book, you'll be well on your way to becoming an expert Vue developer who can leverage design patterns to efficiently architect the design of your application and write clean and maintainable code.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
console.log('start');
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));
setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
console.log('end')
```

In this book, we assume that the reader has good knowledge of the Vue.js framework, a good knowledge of JavaScript, and basic knowledge of EcmaScript 6.

In addition, to run the examples, the reader needs to install Node.js and have a very basic understanding of node package manager (npm).

Finally, to use the Git repository of this book, the user needs to install Git and have a basic understanding of Git commands.
